# The configuration file needs to define the sources, 
# the channels and the sinks.
# Sources, channels and sinks are defined per agent, 
# in this case called 'agent'

#agent.sources = seqGenSrc

#agent.sinks = loggerSink

# For each one of the sources, the type is defined
#agent.sources.seqGenSrc.type = seq

# The channel can be defined as follows.
#agent.sources.seqGenSrc.channels = memoryChannel

# Each sink's type must be defined
#agent.sinks.loggerSink.type = logger

#Specify the channel the sink should use
#agent.sinks.loggerSink.channel = memoryChannel

# Each channel's type is defined.

# Other config values specific to each type of channel(sink or source)
# can be defined as well
# In this case, it specifies the capacity of the memory channel
